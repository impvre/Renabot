## Requirements

- Both you and the bot need **Manage Expressions** permission
- The bot must be in both the source and target servers
- To get a server ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord and right-click a server

## Emoji & Sticker Limits

The bot respects Discord's server limits based on boost level:

**Emojis:**
- No boost: 50 emojis
- Level 1: 100 emojis
- Level 2: 150 emojis
- Level 3: 250 emojis

**Stickers:**
- No boost: 5 stickers
- Level 1: 15 stickers
- Level 2: 30 stickers
- Level 3: 60 stickers

## Setup

The bot is already configured and running! Just invite it to your servers and start using the commands.

## How to Use

1. Invite the bot to both the source server (where emojis are) and target server (where you want them)
2. Get the source server's ID (right-click server â†’ Copy Server ID)
3. In the target server, use `/stealemojis <server_id>` or `/stealstickers <server_id>`
4. Watch the progress as emojis/stickers are copied!

## Owner Commands

The `/addbotmoji` command is hidden from regular users and only visible to the bot owner. This allows you to add custom emojis that the bot can use in its messages and embeds.

## Notes

- The bot will stop if it reaches your server's emoji/sticker limit
- Failed emojis/stickers will be listed in the result
- Progress updates every 10 emojis to avoid rate limiting
